# AllReacts for Facebook Stories
AllReacts is a browser extension that lets you react to Facebook Stories with any emoji, going beyond the default reactions. With it, you can express yourself more creatively when interacting with friends' Stories.

## Features

- **React with any emoji on Stories**: No longer limited to Facebook's default emojis, you can choose and react with any emoji you like on Stories.
- **Unseen Facebook Stories**: View Facebook Stories without showing up as "seen," so others won’t know you've viewed their stories.
- **Simple and easy-to-use interface**: The extension has a user-friendly interface for quick and easy interaction.

## Installation

1. **Clone** the repository (or Download ZIP):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DuckCIT/AllReacts-for-Facebook-Stories.git
    ```
2. **Load the extension** on your browser:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/` on Chrome or `edge://extensions/` on Edge.
   - Enable **Developer mode**.
   - Select **Load unpacked** and choose the project folder.

3. **Launch** the extension: Once installed, the AllReacts Facebook icon will appear on your browser toolbar.
